<h1>From the Ground Up</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this page is to demonstrate the concepts of building up a website from the ground up, starting with an empty HTML document.</p>

<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<p>HTML consists of elements that, when combined, make up the architecture of a website. Common elements include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headings</li>
  <li>Paragraphs</li>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li>Links</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings are used to describe the content of a page or section and should be used in a hierarchical manner. The most important heading on a page should be an h1 element, and subsequent headings should use h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements to create a heading hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Paragraphs are used to contain chunks of text that together form a readable section of content. Long paragraphs can be broken up into smaller sections using the p element.</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are used to present related information in a logical and organized manner. There are two types of lists: unordered and ordered. Unordered lists use the ul element and list items are marked up with the li element. Ordered lists use the ol element and list items are marked up with the li element.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Links are used to navigate between pages on a website. Links can also be used to point to external websites. Links are marked up with the a element and the href attribute.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Images are used to illustrate or supplement a piece of content. Images are marked up with the img element and the src attribute.</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Tables are used to present data in a tabular format. Tables are marked up with the table element and rows and columns are marked up with the tr and td elements respectively.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This page has demonstrated the basic building blocks of an HTML document and how they can be used to create a functioning website.</p>
